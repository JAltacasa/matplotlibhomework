When we observe the results of the analysis, I am drawn to the following three conclusions:
1. Capomulin is able to reduce the volume of tumors.The other drugs have little to no effect in doing so, showing similar results to the placebo. The drug Ketapril even seemed to perform worse in terms of reducing the tumor volume than the placebo. However it is likely this is because of the specific cancer, and test animal.
2. Neither of the drugs is capable of reducing the number of metastatic sites. There they are incapable of stopping the cancer from spreading. However, Capomulin, and to a lesser degree Infonubil both seemed to cause a slower increase of metastatic sites than Ketapril and the placebo.
3. Despite the last observation, it is so that less mice die in the case of Capomulin, telling us that the survivability chance (in mice), is at least higher than for other drugs or no drug.
